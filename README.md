# Hi!


I'm a second year PhD student in Linguistics at Boston University. I am fascinated by both the systematicity and variation of human language. My work investigates the ways in which syntax, morphology, and phonology interact to create this complexity. You can find more information on my research on my [projects](projects) page. 

I also work in language documentation and revitalization. Recently, I joined a project with [Harvard's WOLF lab](https://linguistics.fas.harvard.edu/wolf-lab), to document the Alabama language on the Alabama-Coushatta reservation in Texas. I am also active in the development of language resources for younger learners.
